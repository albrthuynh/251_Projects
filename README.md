This repository is to show the skills that I have learned with data structures and algorithms

This repository has 2 programs that I believe show my understanding with the topics of binary search tress and using the data structures to help find the shortest destination between
two people, using their exact location, and showing the path from building to building using UIC as the landmark which this program is based on.
